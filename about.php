        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
            Welcome to <?php echo $websitename ?>. Here you can find more statistics and information on your ranked games.
            Using the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/" target="_blank">Riot API</a> we store your ranked games into our system, so they could be grabbed out quickly when needed.
            We use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> for most of our site's styling.
            We use <a href="http://fontawesome.io/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> for some of the icons on the site.
            Our logo as well as some of the graphics were created by <a href="http://7bot.lol/index.php?r=&name=zexzah" target="_blank">Zexzah</a>.
            I would also like to give credit to <a href="http://kittyconqueso.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">KittyConQueso</a> for the ward icons used in our match display
            (<a href="http://kittyconqueso.deviantart.com/art/Pink-Ward-Emote-455473659" target="_blank"><img src="assets/ward_pink.png" height="20", width="20"></a>).
            7 Bot started in January of 2016 as a <a href="assets/old_ranked.png" target="_blank">personal local website</a> where I manually added information on my ranked games.
            Then I thought I should try using the Riot API to automatically add information from my ranked games that it could grab, and add my grade, rank, and lp manually.
            The name 7 Bot is an inside joke with my friends; we usually say '7bot' in chat when we get ganked in the bot lane, meaning 7 people are ganking bot.
            The reason I chose the name 7 Bot for the website is because I wanted a unique feel for the name, not being something generic as 'Ranked Games'/'Ranked Lookup'.
