7bot todo:
/ name: create original name for the site (7Bot) (Easy Stats) (Easy Ranked Stats) (LolLookup)
- limit: limit ammounts of games added per ip address?
- top list: take all info from database to create top list (for each region?)
/ new stat: time played ranked
/ time estimate: estimated time to add games
/ confirm button: confirm to add games
/ all seasons tab: merge all tables
/ match.php: matches table?
/ a way to fix riot api's fuckups with correct lane (add a checker for some things, i.e. no doubles of lanes. if player has smite, then theyre more likely the jungler, etc.)
/ pages: limit amount of rows seen at once, customizable by the user
/ bring back the stats. on seperate page? more indepth?
/ games: update the games table to be skinnier to look better on smaller resolutions.
- fix the matches and games with 3v3 twisted treeline games.
/ add keystones into the games and matches.
/ re-add a way to change the user ordering for the table.
- add a confirm button to match.php
- convert match.php to grab and set player's info from their own table instead of storing everyones info in the matches table.
/ change all the calls to the static riot api to get champion names from their ids. instead use our local champions table. (should speed a lot of shit up) (Update: Sped it up indeed, except had to add manual sleep() or we will exceed the api limit.)
